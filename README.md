# Buoy

A minimal always-on static file server for web developers on macOS. See https://buoy.joelryan.com.

The Buoy server is free and open source.

There is also a closed-source one-click macOS version that includes an icon, menu, and a utility for automatically starting Buoy from the macOS launchd service.
